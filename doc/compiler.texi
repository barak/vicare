Throughout the compiler code variables with the following names appear:

@table @var
@item op
Scheme symbol representing an @strong{operation} to be directly
translated into assembly.  Examples: @samp{alloc}, @samp{mref},
@samp{mref32}, @samp{bref}, @samp{logand}, @samp{logxor}, @samp{logor},
@samp{int+}, @samp{int-}, @samp{int*}, @samp{int-quotient},
@samp{int-remainder}, @samp{sll}, @samp{sra}.

@item rator
Represents a reference to an @strong{operator}: a function coded in
assembly or C language.

@item rands
Scheme list holding the @strong{operands} to which an operation must be
applied.  These operands are in such a format that can be directly used
in the assembly S--expression like:

@example
(make-set eax (car rands))
@end example

@noindent
which generate an assignment operation to store the first element of
@var{rands} into the @code{eax} processor register.
@end table
