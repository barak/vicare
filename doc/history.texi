The original version of this document is by Abdulaziz Ghuloum, who wrote
it in the years 2006-2010, under the title ``Ikarus Scheme User's
Guide''.

In 2008 the original document in TeX format was transformed in Texinfo
format by Marco Maggi.

Starting with 2010 the Texinfo document was renamed to ``Vicare Scheme''
and further developed to be the users's and developer's guide for Vicare
Scheme, a fork of the original Ikarus Scheme.

The documentation of the @srfi{} libraries was written by the original
@srfi{} authors, transformed to Texinfo format and adapted for inclusion
in this document.
