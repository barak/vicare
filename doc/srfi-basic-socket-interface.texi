@subsection Abstract


This document specifies basic socket interfaces.

@node srfi basic-socket rationale
@subsection Rationale


Many Scheme implementations have their own socket @api{}s however there
are no portable way to write socket programs.  Therefore programmers
need to provide implementation dependent layers for their programs.

This document specifies high and middle range of socket interfaces which
are commonly used for socket programming.  It should make it easier to
write portable programs that need to send or receive data from their
socket.

@c page
@node srfi basic-socket spec cons
@subsubsection Constructors and predicates


The following bindings are exported by the libraries @library{srfi :106}
and @library{srfi :106 socket}.


@defun make-client-socket @var{node} @var{service}
@defunx make-client-socket @var{node} @var{service} @var{ai-family}
@defunx make-client-socket @var{node} @var{service} @var{ai-family} @var{ai-socktype}
@defunx make-client-socket @var{node} @var{service} @var{ai-family} @var{ai-socktype} @var{ai-flags}
@defunx make-client-socket @var{node} @var{service} @var{ai-family} @var{ai-socktype} @var{ai-flags} @var{ai-protocol}
Return a client socket connected to an Internet address.

The Internet address is identified by @var{node} and @var{service}.
@var{node} and @var{service} must be strings.  Example values for
@var{node}: @samp{"localhost"}, @samp{127.0.0.1}.  Example values for
@var{service}: @samp{"http"}, @samp{"80"}.

The optional arguments may specify the created socket's behaviour.  If
the optional arguments are omitted, then the following value should be
used as default:

@table @var
@item ai-family
Defaults to: @code{*af-inet*}.

@item ai-socktype
Defaults to: @code{*sock-stream*}.

@item ai-flags
Defaults to: @code{(socket-merge-flags *ai-v4mapped* *ai-addrconfig*)}.

@item ai-protocol
Defaults to: @code{*ipproto-ip*}.
@end table

The returned socket may not be closed automatically so it is the users'
responsibility to close it explicitly.
@end defun


@defun make-server-socket @var{service}
@defunx make-server-socket @var{service} @var{ai-family}
@defunx make-server-socket @var{service} @var{ai-family} @var{ai-socktype}
@defunx make-server-socket @var{service} @var{ai-family} @var{ai-socktype} @var{ai-protocol}
Return a server socket waiting for connection.

The @var{node} argument is the same as the one of
@func{make-client-socket}.  The optional arguments may specify the
created socket's behaviour.  If the optional arguments are omitted, then
the following value should be used as default:

@table @var
@item ai-family
Defaults to: @code{*af-inet*}.

@item @var{ai-socktype}
Defaults to: @code{*sock-stream*}.

@item @var{ai-protocol}
Defaults to: @code{*ipproto-ip*}.
@end table

The returned socket may not be closed automatically so it is the users'
responsibility to close it explicitly.
@end defun


@defun socket? @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a socket object, @false{} otherwise.
@end defun

@c page
@node srfi basic-socket spec ops
@subsubsection Socket operations


The following bindings are exported by the libraries @library{srfi :106}
and @library{srfi :106 socket}.


@defun socket-accept @var{socket}
Wait for an incoming connection request, and return a fresh connected
client socket.
@end defun


@defun socket-send @var{socket} @var{bv}
@defunx socket-send @var{socket} @var{bv} @var{flags}
Send a binary data block to a socket and return the sent data size.

@var{flags} may specify the procedure's behaviour.  If @var{flags} is
omitted: the default value must be the result of evaluating the form:

@example
(message-type none)
@end example
@end defun


@defun socket-recv @var{socket} @var{size}
@defunx socket-recv @var{socket} @var{size} @var{flags}
Receive a binary data block from a socket.  If a zero--length bytevector
is returned: it means the peer connection is closed.

@var{flags} may specify the procedure's behaviour.  If @var{flags} is
omitted, the default value must be the result of evaluating the form:

@example
(message-type none)
@end example
@end defun


@defun socket-shutdown @var{socket} @var{how}
Shutdown a socket.  @var{how} must be one of the following constants:
@code{*shut-rd*}, @code{*shut-wr*}, @code{*shut-rdwr*}.
@end defun


@defun socket-close @var{socket}
Close a socket.  The procedure should not shutdown the given socket: to
shutdown a socket @func{socket-shutdown} should be called explicitly.
@end defun

@c page
@node srfi basic-socket spec port
@subsubsection Port conversion


The following bindings are exported by the libraries @library{srfi :106}
and @library{srfi :106 socket}.


@defun socket-input-port @var{socket}
@defunx socket-output-port @var{socket}
Return a fresh binary input or output port associated with a
@var{socket}, respectively.  Whenever the returned port is closed: the
associated socket must @strong{not} be closed along.

@quotation
@strong{For Vicare:} it is fine to use @func{transcoded-port} from
@rsixlibrary{io ports} to put a textual port on top of the returned
binary ports.  Example:

@example
(import (vicare)
  (prefix (srfi :106) srfi.))

(with-compensations
  (define socket
    (compensate
        (srfi.make-client-socket "reddit.com" "http")
      (with
       (srfi.socket-shutdown socket
         (srfi.shutdown-method read write))
       (srfi.socket-close socket))))

  (define in-port
    (compensate
        (transcoded-port (srfi.socket-input-port socket)
                         (native-transcoder))
      (with
       (close-port in-port))))

  (define ou-port
    (compensate
        (transcoded-port (srfi.socket-output-port socket)
                         (native-transcoder))
      (with
       (close-port ou-port))))

  ---)
@end example

It is also fine to use the returned ports as @var{port} argument to the
functions @func{select-port}, @func{select-port-readable?},
@func{select-port-writable?}, @func{select-port-exceptional?}.
@end quotation
@end defun

@c page
@node srfi basic-socket spec control
@subsubsection Control features


The following bindings are exported by the libraries @library{srfi :106}
and @library{srfi :106 socket}.


@defun call-with-socket @var{socket} @var{proc}
Call a given procedure with a given socket as an argument.  If
@var{proc} returns: @func{call-with-socket} returns the result of
@var{proc} and @var{socket} is automatically closed.  If @var{proc} does
not return: then @var{socket} is not closed automatically.
@end defun
