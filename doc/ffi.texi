@chapter Foreign functions interface


The library @library{vicare ffi} interfaces with the host operating
system and other external libraries exposing a C language interface; it
is suggested to import the @ffi{} library with the prefix @code{ffi.},
as in the following prelude:

@example
#!r6rs
(import (rnrs)
  (prefix (vicare ffi) ffi.))
@end example

The facilities of the @library{vicare ffi} give the Scheme program
unrestricted access to the computer memory, allowing one to allocate,
access, modify, and free memory as needed.  The facilities also allow
the Scheme program to @dfn{call out} to system procedures as well as
allow the native procedures to @dfn{call back} into Scheme.

Additionally, @library{vicare ffi} reexports all the bindings from the
library @library{ikarus system $foreign}.

@section Installing and using Libffi


Currently @value{PRJNAME} implements the foreign--functions interface
(@ffi{}) using an extenal library: Libffi, originally by Anthony Green.
Libffi can be found at:

@center @url{http://sourceware.org/libffi/}

@noindent
and it is distributed under a liberal license (look for it at the site,
basically we can do everything but remove the original copyright
notice).

On Unix--like systems, we can install Libffi with the traditional
sequence:

@example
$ ./configure [options]
$ make
$ make install
@end example

@noindent
and the makefile supports the @env{DESTDIR} environment variable for
installation under a different directory prefix.

@quotation
@strong{NOTE} Libffi version 3.0.10 installs its header files under:

@example
$@{prefix@}/lib/libffi-3.0.10/include
@end example

@noindent
and trying to use the @option{--includedir} option to
@command{configure} will @strong{not} work in changing this.  It means
that when configuring @value{PRJNAME} for installation we have to specify where
the Libffi headers are to be found; @ref{overview install} for details.

@section Accessing foreign objects from Scheme


Most system implementations of dynamic loading employ reference counting
for @func{dlopen} and @func{dlclose} in that library resources are not
freed until the number of calls to @func{dlclose} matches the number of
calls to @func{dlopen}.  The following bindings are exported by
@library{vicare ffi}.


@defun dlopen
@defunx dlopen @var{library-name}
@defunx dlopen @var{library-name} @var{lazy?} @var{global?}
Interface to the C function @cfunc{dlopen}, see the manual page
@code{dlopen(3)}.  Load a platform shared library and return a pointer
object representing a handler for the library, which can be used as
argument for @func{dlsym} and @func{dlclose}.  If the library cannot be
loaded: return @false{} and the procedure @func{dlerror} can be used to
obtain the cause of the failure.

When no arguments are present: the returned pointer handler references
the current process and it can be used to retrieve pointers to functions
already loaded, for example the functions exported by the standard C
library.  The @var{lazy?} and @var{global?} arguments are meaningless in
this case.

When given: @var{library-name} must be a string or a bytevector
representing the name of the library; if it is a string: it is converted
to bytevector using the function referenced by
@func{filename->string-func}.

Library names are system--dependent and must include the appropriate
suffix (for exapmle @code{*.so} on Linux, @code{*.dylib} on Darwin and
@code{*.dll} on Cygwin).  @var{library-name} may include a full path
which identifies the location of the library, or it may just be the name
of the library in which case the system will lookup the library name
using the @env{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} environment variable.

The argument @var{lazy?} specifies how library dependencies are loaded.
If true, @func{dlopen} delays the resolution and loading of dependent
libraries until they are actually used.  If false, all library
dependencies are loaded before the call to @func{dlopen} returns.
@var{lazy?} defaults to @false{}.

The argument @var{global?} specifies the scope of the symbols exported
from the loaded library.  If true, all exported symbols become part of
the running image, and subsequent @func{dlsym} calls may not need to
specify the library from which the symbol is loaded.  If false, the
exported symbols are not global and the library pointer needs to be
specified for @func{dlsym}.  @var{global?} defaults to @false{}.
@end defun


@defun dlclose @var{handle}
Interface to the C function @cfunc{dlclose}, see the manual page
@code{dlclose(3)}.  Release the resources loaded from the library
referenced by the pointer handler @var{handle}.  If successful return
@true{}, else return @false{} and @func{dlerror} can be used to obtain
the cause of the error.

Closing a library renders all symbols and static data structures that
the library exports invalid and the program may crash or corrupt its
memory if such symbols are used after a library is closed.
@end defun


@defun dlsym @var{handle} @var{name}
Interface to the C function @cfunc{dlsym}, see the manual page
@code{dlsym(3)}.  Search the loaded library referenced by the pointer
@var{handle} for an exported symbol whose name is represented by the
string @var{name}.  If successful return a pointer object, else return
@false{} and @code{dlerror} can be used to obtain the cause of the
error.

If the returned value references a function: it can be used as argument
to the callout generators built by @func{make-c-callout-maker}.
@end defun


@defun dlerror
Interface to the C function @cfunc{dlerror}, see the manual page
@code{dlerror(3)}.  If any of the dynamic loading operations fails, the
cause of the error can be obtained by calling @func{dlerror} which
returns a string describing the error; return @false{} if there was no
dynamic loading error.
@end defun

@c page
@node ffi shared
@section System--agnostic shared libraries @api{}


This @api{} to load shared libraries is more system--agnostic with
respect to the functions described in @ref{ffi dl}.  The following
bindings are exported by @library{vicare ffi}.


@defun open-shared-object
@defunx open-shared-object @var{so-name}
Load a platform shared library and return a pointer object representing
a handler for the library.  If the library cannot be loaded: raise a
non--continuable exception with condition types @condition{who},
@condition{message}, @condition{shared-object-opening-error}.

When no arguments are present: the returned pointer handler references
the current process and it can be used to retrieve pointers to functions
already loaded, for example the functions exported by the standard C
library.

When given: @var{so-name} must be a string representing the name of the
library; library names are system--dependent and must include the
appropriate suffix (for exapmle @code{*.so} on Linux, @code{*.dylib} on
Darwin and @code{*.dll} on Cygwin).  @var{so-name} may include a full
path which identifies the location of the library, or it may just be the
name of the library.

@quotation
@strong{For Unix} We can find documentation about the search path of
shared objects in the manual page of @cfunc{dlopen}.  The system will
lookup the library name using the @env{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} environment
variable.
@end quotation
@end defun


@defun close-shared-object @var{so-handle}
Release the resources loaded from the library referenced by the
@var{so-handle}.  If the library cannot be closed: raise a
non--continuable exception with condition types @condition{who},
@condition{message}, @condition{shared-object-closing-error}.

Closing a library renders all symbols and static data structures that
the library exports invalid and the program may crash or corrupt its
memory if such symbols are used after a library is closed.
@end defun


@defun lookup-shared-object @var{so-handle} @var{name}
Search the loaded library referenced by the @var{so-handle} for an
exported symbol whose name is represented by the Scheme string
@var{name}.  If successful return a pointer object, else raise a
non--continuable exception with condition types @condition{who},
@condition{message}, @condition{shared-object-lookup-error}.

If the returned value references a function: it can be used as argument
to the callout generators built by @func{make-c-callout-maker}.

@section Callouts and callbacks


Callouts allow Scheme code to invoke C functions in a foreign library;
callbacks allow foreign C code to call a Scheme function.  The following
example shows how Scheme code can call a callout which in turns calls a
callback:

@example
#!r6rs
(import (rnrs)
  (prefix (vicare ffi) ffi.))

(define callout-maker
  (ffi.make-c-callout-maker  'unsigned-int '(unsigned-int)))

(define callback-maker
  (ffi.make-c-callback-maker 'unsigned-int '(unsigned-int)))

(define callback
  (callback-maker values))

(define callout
  (callout-maker callback))

(callout 123)   @result{} 123

(ffi.free-c-callback callback)

@c page
@node ffi call intro
@subsection Overview of @ffi{} function calls


Both callouts and callbacks are built on top of function signatures
specifying the type of function arguments and returned value.  Libffi
allows us to specify such signatures through a Call InterFace (@cif{})
data structure; @value{PRJNAME} internally extends such a structure with
additional data to speed up marshaling of values from Scheme to native
representation and back.

At present, @cif{} data structures are allocated with @cfunc{malloc} and
never released.  Callouts and callbacks make use of @cif{} structures of
the same format, so such structures are internally cached; a single
@cif{} associated to a given function signature is used by all the
callouts and callbacks having the same signature.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Calling out to foreign functions

Callouts require only a @cif{} structure and the address of the foreign
C function; no additional structure needs to be allocated and then
released.

@value{PRJNAME} organises the callout @api{} by creating a callout maker
function, closed upon a @cif{} structure, which can build any number of
callout functions associating the @cif{} to foreign function pointers.
Maker functions are cached internally, so only one maker function for a
given signature is created in a running process.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Calling back to Scheme functions

Callbacks require an additional data structure, because they must
generate at runtime callable machine code referenced by a pointer; such
additional data structure cannot be automatically released by the
garbage collector, but it can be explicitly freed by the program when
the callback is no longer needed.

We can think of the code handling a callback as organised like the
following pseudo--code:

@example
cif_t  call_interface;

int
specific_callback (int a, long b, double c)
@{
  void *  args[3] = @{ &a, &b, &c @};
  int     result;
  generic_callback(&call_interface, &result, args);
  return result;
@}

void
generic_callback (cif_t * call_interface,
                  void * result, void * args)
@{
  scheme_value  s_a, s_b, s_c;
  scheme_value  s_result;
  s_a = native_to_scheme(call_interface, 0, args);
  s_b = native_to_scheme(call_interface, 1, args);
  s_c = native_to_scheme(call_interface, 2, args);
  s_result = scheme_callback(s_a, s_b, s_c);
  scheme_to_native(call_interface, result, s_result);
@}

scheme_value
scheme_callback (scheme_value s_a,
                 scheme_value s_b,
                 scheme_value s_c)
@{
  /* process arguments, return result */
@}
@end example

@noindent
where: @code{specific_callback} is generated at runtime by Libffi;
@code{generic_callback}, @code{scheme_to_native} and
@code{native_to_scheme} are implemented by @value{PRJNAME}'s runtime
(using generic operations); @code{scheme callback} is implemented by the
Scheme program.  A pointer to @code{specific_callback} is the one we
need to acquire when creating a callback from Scheme.

@value{PRJNAME} organises the callback @api{} by creating a callback
maker function, closed upon a @cif{} structure, which can build any
number of callback functions associating the @cif{} to Scheme functions.
Maker functions are cached internally, so only one maker function for
each given signature is created in a running process.

@c page
@node ffi call out
@subsection Calling out to foreign procedures


In order to call out to a foreign procedure, we must provide two pieces
of information: the signature of the foreign procedure and the address
of the procedure in memory.  The signature must usually be hard--coded
into the program; the address is obtained using @func{dlsym}.

Using the signature, the @ffi{} determines how Scheme values are
converted to and from native values; a signature is composed of two
parts: a Scheme symbol specifying the return type, a list of Scheme
symbols specifying the argument types.

Here is a simple example, without error checking, showing how to
interface to the C function @cfunc{sinh}:

@example
#!r6rs
(import (vicare)
  (prefix (vicare ffi) ffi.))

(define libc
  (ffi.dlopen))

(define sinh-address
  (ffi.dlsym libc "sinh"))

(define callout-maker
  (ffi.make-c-callout-maker 'double '(double)))

(define sinh
  (callout-maker sinh-address))

(sinh 1.2)      @result{} 1.5094613554121725
@end example

@noindent
using the @ffi{} we build a callout function generator which can be used
to create any number of callout functions having the same signature.
Generated callout functions are garbage collected like any other Scheme
value.


@defun make-c-callout-maker @var{ret-type} @var{arg-types}
Build and return a function to be used to generate callout Scheme
functions wrapping foreign functions which follow the C language
conventions for calling, arguments and return values.

The returned generator function accepts as single argument a pointer
object representing the address of a foreign function; the value
returned by the generator function is a Scheme closure wrapping the
foreign function.  The wrapper Scheme closure takes care of marshaling
Scheme values as appropriate for the underlying platform.

@var{ret-type} must be a Scheme symbol specifying the type of the
returned value; if the foreign function returns no value: @var{ret-type}
must be the symbol @code{void}.

@var{arg-types} must be a list of Scheme symbols specifying the type of
the arguments; if the foreign function accepts no arguments:
@var{arg-types} must be nil or the list @code{(void)}.

@ref{ffi call types} for the specification of accepted type symbols.
@end defun


@defun make-c-callout-maker/with-errno @var{ret-type} @var{arg-types}
Like @func{make-c-callout-maker}, but the generated callout closures
will return two values: the return value from the foreign function call
and the value of the C language variable @code{errno} right after the
foreign function call.
@end defun

@c page
@node ffi call back
@subsection Calling back to Scheme


In order to arrange for a foreign library to callback to a Scheme
function we need a suitable Scheme function and the signature of the
procedure the foreign library expects.  The signature must usually be
hard--coded in the program.

Using the signature, the @ffi{} determines how native values are
converted to and from Scheme values; a signature is composed of two
parts: a Scheme symbol specifying the return type, a list of Scheme
symbols specifying the argument types.  The signature format is the same
as the one used for callouts; @ref{ffi call out} for details.

Note that a callback function is indistinguishable from other native
procedures whose address is obtained using @func{dlsym} or similar
means.  In particular, such native pointers can be passed to callout
generators resulting in a Scheme procedure that calls out to the native
procedure that in turn calls back into Scheme.

The following example shows how to create an identity function for
native integers composed by a Scheme function calling out to a foreign
function, calling back to the Scheme function @func{values}:

@example
#!r6rs
(import (vicare)
  (prefix (vicare ffi) ffi.))

(define callout-maker
  (ffi.make-c-callout-maker  'unsigned-int '(unsigned-int)))

(define callback-maker
  (ffi.make-c-callback-maker 'unsigned-int '(unsigned-int)))

(define identity
  (callout-maker (callback-maker values)))

(identity 123)  @result{} 123
@end example

@noindent
using the @ffi{} we build a callback function generator which can be
used to create any number of callback functions having the same
signature.  Generated callback functions are @strong{not} garbage
collected like the other Scheme values.


@defun make-c-callback-maker @var{ret-type} @var{arg-types}
Build and return a function to be used to generate callback functions
following the C language conventions for calling, arguments and return
values and wrapping Scheme functions.

The returned generator function accepts as single argument the Scheme
function to be wrapped; the value returned by the generator function is
a pointer object referencing a native function.  The wrapper native
function takes care of marshaling Scheme values as appropriate for the
underlying platform.

@var{ret-type} must be a Scheme symbol specifying the type of the
returned value; if the callback function must return no value:
@var{ret-type} must be the symbol @code{void}.

@var{arg-types} must be a list of Scheme symbols specifying the type of
the arguments; if the callback function must accept no arguments:
@var{arg-types} must be nil or the list @code{(void)}.

@ref{ffi call types} for the specification of accepted type symbols.
@end defun


@defun free-c-callback @var{c-callback-pointer}
Release the resources associated to the given C pointer referencing a
callback function.  If the pointer is not a callback pointer: raise an
assertion violation.
@end defun

@c page
@node ffi call types
@subsection Specifying native types


The following is a list of Scheme symbols used to specify native types
for both callouts and callbacks.  If a type is not available on a
platform: the callout and callback generators will raise an error if the
associated type specifier is used.

@table @code

@itemx unsigned-char
Exact integers in the range for @code{char} and @code{unsigned char}.

@item signed-short
@itemx unsigned-short
