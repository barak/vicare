Description: Scheme compiler and interpreter
 Vicare, a fork of Ikarus, is a compiler-based implementation of the
 Scheme programming language, which targets the i386 (with sse2) and
 AMD64 architectures.  It has good performance, is rather light
 weight, is case-sensitive, and implements a substantial portion of
 the language described in R6RS.
