* Matthew Flatt distributed  the R6RS test suite embedded  in the Vicare
  distribution.  The tests are distributed  under the GNU GPL version 2,
  or any later version.

  Y.   FUJITA   /   LittleWing    Company   Limited.    See   the   file
  "COPYING.ypsilon" for terms and conditions of use of this function.

* https://github.com/sunderroy: contributed a fix  for IMPORT allowing a
  mixture of module names and library specs.

* http://github.com/sunderroy: contributed  a fix for EXPORT  allowing a
  module to export its bindings to the enclosing region.

* Barak A.  Pearlmutter  provided a number of changes for  better use of
  the GNU Autotools.

* http://github.com/ChaosEternal: performed  a bisection  search helping
  to fix issue 29 (broken support for 64-bit architectures).

* Peope  listed  here  contributed  comments,  suggestions,  criticisms,
  release  testing and  bug reports  which have  helped fix  and improve
  Vicare Scheme:

* Mark H Weaver posted on the  guile-devel mailing list a patch to allow
  SRFI 45 to handle multiple values.

## ------------------------------------------------------------
## Below are the contributors of Ikarus

People  listed  in this  file  have  contributed comments,  suggestions,
criticisms, and bug reports which  have helped me fix and improve Ikarus
Scheme.  Without their contributions,  my job would've been much harder.
I'm very thankful.

====================================================================
VERSION 0.0.2:

* Everybody  who took the  time to  email me  when Ikarus  was released.
  Thanks for the encouragements.

* Eric  Hanchrow  (offby1)  reported  the  first public  bug  on  bignum
  division error

* Wolfram Fenske helped  test porting the system to  NetBSD and FreeBSD,
  increasing the number of supported platforms from 3 to 5.  The Solaris
  port is still unfinished though.

* Tom  Gordon reported  installation  problems on  64-bit systems  which
  resulted in improving the error report of the configure script.

* Jens Axel  SÃžgaard(and his brother) provided  solutions for compiling
  Ikarus on 64-bit machines.

* Andre van  Tonder reported expansion problems  for top-level programs.
  He also made suggestions for improving the user's guide.

* Michael  Adams helped  in  a zillion  things  including fixing  typos,
  making   the  command-line  procedure   consistent  for   scripts  and
  interactive sessions,  installing the boot  file in a  proper location
  (along  with some  help in  using  automake and  autoconf), filed  bug
  reports (on  expt, modulo, error,  get-line, number->string, truncate,
  fltruncate,   flabs,   substring,   define-record-type,  put-u8,   the
  expander, and  the compiler), and helped  cut startup time  in half by
  instrumenting the ikarus loader.

* Phil Bewig wrote SRFI-41 (streams)  in R6RS, which loads flawlessly in
  Ikarus.

* Felix Klock reported (indirectly) that the +nan.0 and +inf.0 should be
  case insensitive.

* Derick Eddington  reported garbage collection problems  with code that
  only  uses bignum  arithmetic.   Also reported  problems with  reading
  identifiers containing unicode escape  sequences and corrected a minor
  bug with export classifications.

* Kent Dybvig approved of an  idea for optimizing closures that resulted
  in cutting the bootstrap time in half.

* Will Clinger indirectly reported that Ikarus does not support the
  #!r6rs comment.


====================================================================
VERSION 0.0.1:

* Kent Dybvig  and Michael Adams  both advised that the  initial release
  should build  and install using  the standard ./configure,  make, make
  install sequence.   This made the  lauch of Ikarus very  successful as
  people had little or no problems building and installing it.

* Will Byrd gave suggestions about the minimum stuff that should go into
  the user's guide and suggested having a small R6RS tutorial.

* Roshan James  bugged me to port  Ikarus to Windows.  Only  half of his
  wish came true (cygwin is not windows in his dictionary).
