1. Introduction
---------------

This directory contains scripts and  data files showing program examples
with Vicare Scheme.


2. Demo networking clients
--------------------------

2.1 CONNECT client
------------------

SYNOPSIS

   vicare connect.sps [vicare options] -- IFACE PORT [connect options]

DESCRIPTION

The  script  "connect.sps"  is  similar to  the  command  "telnet",  but
simpler: it connects to a server  from a terminal and exchanges messages
represented by strings terminated by \n or \r\n.

  When the option "--recv-first" is  used: CONNECT expects the server to
send the first message.  When the option "--send-first" is used: CONNECT
expects the user at the terminal to type in the first message.


3. Demo networking servers
--------------------------

3.1 ECHO server
---------------

SYNOPSIS

   vicare echod.sps [vicare options] [-- [echod options]]

DESCRIPTION

The script "echod.sps" implements the classic echo server: if we connect
to it and  send it strings, it  will just echo them back  to the client.
Upon receiving  a connection: the  server sends a greetings  string.  By
default it listens to localhost:8081.

  Internally it makes use of the following notable libraries:

   (vicare posix)
   (vicare posix pid-files)
   (vicare posix log-files)
   (vicare posix simple-event-loop)
   (srfi :37 args-fold)

this demo program is especially a demonstration of the Simple Event Loop
library.

  When  the client  sends the  string "quit\n"  or "quit\r\n":  the ECHO
server closes  the connection.   To terminate the  ECHO server:  we must
send it  a SIGTERM signal,  possibly using the  pid file to  acquire the
process ID.


3.2 SHELLD server
-----------------

To be written.


3.3 HTTP server
---------------

		 *THIS PROGRAM is NOT FINISHED*

The script  "httpd.sps" is a *toy*  web server capable of  serving pages
from a customisable document root directory.  Start it with:

   $ vicare demos/httpd.sps -- \
	--document-root /path/to/root

and terminate it by sending it a SIGINT signal (Ctrl-c).  By default the
server binds itself to localhost:8080.
