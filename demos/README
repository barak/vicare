			  ============


This directory  contains scripts  and data files  showing program
examples with Vicare Scheme.


HTTP server
-----------

The script "httpd.sps"  is a *toy* web server  capable of serving
pages  from a  customisable  document root  directory.  Start  it
with:

   $ vicare demos/httpd.sps -- \
	--document-root /path/to/root

and  terminate it  by sending  it a  SIGINT signal  (Ctrl-c).  By
default the server binds itself to localhost:8080.
