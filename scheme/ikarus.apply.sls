;;Limit artificially set; notice that it  is the maximum number of items
;;in the  last argument of APPLY,  not the maximum number  of arguments.
;;This limit  attempts to  mitigate the risk  of Scheme  stack overflow,
;;which is be detected at run time.

;;As comparison:  LispWorks for Unix  sets this value to  300, LispWorks
;;for Windows and LispWorks for Linux set this value to 255.

(case-define apply
  ;;Defined  by  R6RS.   LS  must  be  a list.   PROC  should  accept  N
  ;;arguments, where N is number of arguments A plus the length of LS.
  ;;
  ;;The APPLY procedure calls PROC with the elements of the list:
  ;;
  ;;   (append (list A ...) LS)
  ;;
  ;;as the actual arguments.
  ;;
  ;;If a  call to APPLY occurs  in a tail  context, the call to  PROC is
  ;;also in a tail context.
  ;;
  ;;NOTE In  case of  last argument being  a list too  long: we  want to
  ;;raise   an   "&implementation-restriction-violation",  so   we   use
  ;;"with-arguments-validation"   rather   than    the   predicates   of
  ;;CASE-DEFINE*.
  ;;
  ;;NOTE About "$$apply".   It is a special directive  for the compiler,
  ;;which recognises the  symbol "$$apply" in the core  language.  It is
  ;;not  a proper  primitive operation  implemented with  DEFINE-PRIMOP;
  ;;rather  the  compiler  generates  assembly   code  to  jump  to  the
  ;;predefined assembly routine "SL_apply".
